Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.
Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City.
Tesla soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices.
Tesla's patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant.
Tesla's work in the formative years of electric power development was involved in a corporate alternating current/direct current "War of Currents" as well as various patent battles.
Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs, and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.
Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.
In his lab Tesla also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.
Tesla also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.
Tesla was renowned for his achievements and showmanship, eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an archetypal "mad scientist".
Tesla patents earned him a considerable amount of money, much of which was used to finance his own projects with varying degrees of success.
Tesla lived most of his life in a series of New York hotels, through his retirement.
Tesla died on 7 January 1943.
Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but in 1960 the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.

Scientists have rescued a mouse immune system that was overwhelmed by a systemic blood infection.
Scientists have discovered how infections that invade the whole body, like malaria, disable the immune system and prevent it from detecting and fighting other microorganisms.
The Australian and German researchers say the discovery may help scientists to develop vaccines that restore immunity in people with systemic or 'whole body' infections. 
The Australian and German researchers publish their research today online in the journal Nature Immunology.
The immune response is alerted when specialised sentries of the immune system, dendritic cells, detect a virus or bacteria.
Lead researcher Dr Jose Villadangos, an immunologist from the Walter and Eliza Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, says systemic infections such as malaria or sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood, overstimulate dendritic cells.
"But in the case of malaria infections and sepsis, dendritic cells throughout the body are concentrated on alerting the immune system, which prevents them from detecting and responding to any new infections." 
Villadangos and colleagues managed to restore immunity in mice with an immune system compromised by sepsis.
Villadangos and colleagues injected mice with a live vaccine made of dendritic cells that had been exposed to a secondary virus in the laboratory, and subsequently displayed antigens of that virus. 
Villadangos says the findings show the missing link in the immunosupressed animal is the capacity of the dendritic cells to display the antigens of new viruses. 
"This strategy is already being used in the development of anti-cancer vaccines. We are yet to find out if will work against secondary infections in humans with a systemic infection," Villadangos says.

The US economy has slowed to its weakest pace in two years, as plunging oil prices and global anxiety brought growth to a near standstill.
The economy grew by just 0.1pc in the first quarter of the year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), well below the 0.4pc gain of the previous quarter, and the 0.2pc rise anticipated by analysts.
The disappointing performance marked the third straight year in which US GDP figures have missed the estimates made by forecasters.
Economists attributed much of the weakness to sliding business investment, knocked by jitters over the global economy and weak oil prices.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the figures made for "grim" reading.
Non-housing investment dropped 5.9pc, its largest fall since the second quarter of 2009.
The decline knocked nearly 0.1 percentage points off the quarterly pace of growth.
Mr Shepherdson said that he too had expected a "much better" set of figures for the second quarter of the year, as corporate investment should pick up as "the collapse in oil sector spending diminishes".
Growth was also impacted by a slowdown in consumer spending, as well as the US trade deficit, and rising inventories.
Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, said that the world's largest economy had been buffeted by "multiple headwinds".
"Barring a miracle, it appears that GDP growth is on course for another underwhelming gain of around 2pc this year," he said.
However, the weak growth figures may not prevent the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in the summer months.
Policymakers at the central bank noted slower economic growth in a statement released on Wednesday, but added that jobs market conditions "had improved further" despite that.
Johnny Bo Jakobsen, a Nordea analyst, warned that it would be unwise to extrapolate from the first quarter slowdown.

In the post-match banquet in Madrid on Wednesday night, Bayern Munich's executive chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge stood up, as is the custom, to open proceedings and took the microphone.
To Rummenigge's left sat Pep Guardiola staring at the table.
Rummenigge's address had even been heard before in this country and at this time in the competition; in fact for three campaigns running now he has made the same address and at the same stage of the Champions League and after the same result.
Rummenigge urged Bayern to respond after the first-leg semi-final defeat to Real Madrid two years ago, by the same 1-0 score-line they lost to Atletico Madrid this time round, and did so again, less convincingly after the German champions were taken apart 3-0 by Barcelona last season.
Rummenigge wanted to go to Lisbon, he had said, for the 2014 final but Bayern fell short in the return leg.
No wonder Guardiola looked grim.
Guardiola is the most feted manager in modern football, the one they all coveted, and who commands a 15million-a-year salary yet it will cut him to the core if he leaves Bayern and takes over at Manchester City without having won the Champions League with the German club.
Players and colleagues will trip over themselves to shower praise on the intense transformation he has completed at Bayern and the beauty of the football he has inculcated but and there is that but.
Bayern stay on in the host city for a dinner - English clubs always attempt to fly back - for coaches, players, guests of honour, VIPs and sponsors after Champions League away matches and they did so again in Madrid following the defeat to Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid side at the emotionally-charged Vicente Calderon Stadium.
Simeone's team has collected 33 clean sheets already this season, wearing them like the spoils of war, it has placed Guardiola between a rock and a hard place for the second leg; the irresistible force of Bayern's attack against the immoveable object of Simeone's formidable defence.
There has been that obsession with whether Guardiola's Bayern would face Manuel Pellegrini's City and it may well still happen in the final.
It will be an acute embarrassment for City but a greater one, emphatically, for Guardiola who might face the prospect of again inheriting a Champions League-winning club from a coach who has unwillingly been pushed out to make room for him.
The greater problem for Guardiola, though, is a blunt one.
Guardiola was tactically beaten by Simeone and fell into an obvious trap.
Bayern could not withstand the Atletico high-press from the kick-off as they relentlessly tried to push back their opponents, win the ball back and grab a goal - which they did.
The goal meant Simeone could then switch his approach, as he planned, to a rigorous, disciplined defence.
Bayern are such a good team that they would eventually create chances but the best opportunity actually fell to Fernando Torres who could have killed the tie in a late breakaway but struck the post.
The post-mortem in Munich will centre on Guardiola's decision not to start with Thomas Muller, in particular, and Franck Ribery but the sober fact is that many of his players are out of form and struggling to maintain their season.
Bayern can rescue the situation and win the tie but it will not be easy back at the Allianz Arena next Tuesday when Atletico will go for another goal to end it and begin the debate as to whether Guardiola has failed or, at least, failed to complete his mission.
It is a familiar situation for Guardiola which is why he looked so grim.

Visitors will soon be able to enjoy panoramic views over Dubai from a vertigo-inducing glass-floored walkway on the 80th floor of the tallest skyscraper in the city's new Aykon City development.
Strapped into a harness and secured to a safety rail, daredevils begin their viewing experience on the 78th floor lounge and dining room where they then walk along an open-air ledge before ascending to the glass "viewing capsule" two floors above at nearly 235 metres (935 feet) above the ground.
On a clear day, visitors are said to be able to see as far as 60 kilometres (nearly 40 miles), along the Dubai-Abu Dhabi border, in addition to dramatic vistas over the Business Bay district, Sheikh Zayed Road and the Dubai Canal Project below.
Modelled after Toronto's EdgeWalk of the CN Tower and Auckland's SkyWalk of the Sky Tower, Aykon Dare hopes to offer a "magnificent al fresco experience for the adventurous" and a "breathtaking adrenaline rush", Damac Properties, the developing company behind Akyon City, said in a statement.
The new attraction will form part of the six-tower Aykon City mini-city, which includes a five-star luxury hotel and a collection of luxury apartments, residences and an office tower, in the heart of the Golden Quadrant of Dubai, joining the likes of the emirate's renowned high-rises including the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, and the Jumeirah Emirates Towers.
The development, work on which is reported to begin this summer and be completed by 2021, will also feature a central "elevated plaza" offering various communal spaces and facilities including swimming pools, a children's playground, a running track, an outdoor yoga space, as well as cafes, lounges and luxury boutiques.
The announcement of the Aykon Dare viewing platform follows the opening of Sky Slide in Los Angeles earlier this year, where visitors can travel down the outside of the city's tallest skyscraper via a vertiginous glass slide. 
Starting on the 70th floor, visitors brave enough to go on the slide, which is 45 feet long and 1,000 feet above street level, arrive at a newly-fitted out observation platform at the end, with panoramic views of the city.
The tower, which will become the centrepiece of the Dubai Creek redevelopment project, will be "a notch taller" than the Burj Khalifa, Emaar Properties chairman Mohamed Alabbar revealed at a press conference on Sunday.
Designed by Spanish-Swiss architect Santiago Calatrava Valls, known for futuristic structures such as the City of Arts and Sciences complex in Valencia, Spain, the new Dubai tower will feature a slender, streamlined structure with a needlepoint-like tip, and offer "garden" observation decks decorated with trees and other greenery.
